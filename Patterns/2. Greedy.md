## Step-By-Step Approach
---
### 1. **Learn the 6 Greedy Patterns by Heart**
These cover 90% of greedy questions.

| Pattern                | Example Problem    | Key Idea                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Sort + Pick         | Activity Selection | Sort by value (end time, profit, ratio) |
| 2. Min/Max Heap        | Huffman Coding     | Always pick smallest/largest            |
| 3. Two Pointers        | Gas Station        | Walk and optimize on-the-go             |
| 4. Stack for Decisions | Remove K Digits    | Undo wrong greedy picks                 |
| 5. Sweep Line / Events | Meeting Rooms II   | Track intervals over time               |
| 6. Interval Merging    | Merge Intervals    | Merge overlapping sorted data           |

### 2. **Always Ask These 3 Questions in Greedy Problems**

When you detect a greedy problem, pause and ask:

1. **What greedy choice am I making at each step?** (e.g. pick smallest weight, shortest deadline)
2. **Why does this choice seem safe?** (Try a few examples)
3. **Can I prove it always leads to an optimal answer?** (Greedy stays ahead or exchange arguments)

üëâ Most people **don't stop to prove** the greedy logic. Train yourself to argue ‚Äúwhy‚Äù this greedy choice works.

### 3. **Learn by Example ‚Äî Classic Problems You MUST Master**

Master these 10 first ‚Äî they repeat often:

| Problem                | Pattern                         | Must-Learn Idea                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1. Activity Selection  | Sort by end time                | Pick earliest ending                 |
| 2. Fractional Knapsack | Sort by value/weight            | Greedy ratio choice                  |
| 3. Job Sequencing      | Disjoint set / Latest free slot | Try to delay as late as possible     |
| 4. Huffman Encoding    | Min heap                        | Merge least frequent                 |
| 5. Candy Distribution  | Local min/max                   | Greedy from both sides               |
| 6. Gas Station         | Two Pointers                    | Complete one pass with balance logic |
| 7. Jump Game           | Max reach                       | Greedy range tracking                |
| 8. Partition Labels    | Greedy cuts                     | Greedy until you can cut safely      |
| 9. Remove K Digits     | Monotonic Stack                 | Remove larger to get smaller         |
| 10. Reorganize String  | Max Heap                        | Avoid adjacent duplicates            |

üëâ **Action:** Practice 1 per day. After each, write:
- What was the greedy choice?
- Why did it work?

---

### 4. **Use Templates and Pseudocode Often**

Sometimes you don‚Äôt see a greedy path because your **structure is messy**.

Use this clean format:

```cpp
// Step 1: Sort by (what?)
sort(begin(arr), end(arr), comparator);

// Step 2: Loop and make greedy choices
for (auto &item : arr) {
    if (safe_to_pick(item)) {
        pick(item);
    }
}
```

üëâ You‚Äôll start noticing that 80% greedy problems just need:

- A sort
- A loop
- A greedy pick
