# Problem Solving Framework

(Note: This is my framework to solve a DSA Problem, that I have made using with practice and my learning and thinking pattern. I highly suggest that you create your own with time that is personalized to you.)

1. **Understand**
    - Identify input, output, constraints, edge cases
    - Rephrase the problem in your own words
2. **Estimate**
	- Deduce expected **Time & Space Complexity** from constraints
3. **Identify**
    - Find the **topic/pattern** based on task & keywords
    - Recall similar problems
4. **Map**
    - Match what you **need vs. whatâ€™s given**
    - Think of transitions / decisions
5. **Design**
    - Outline the logic
    - Handle edge cases
6. **Code & Test**
	- Write clean code
	- Test with custom + edge cases
