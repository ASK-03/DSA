### 1. **Master the 5 Core Two Pointer Patterns**

These 5 cover 90% of problems in this category.

| Pattern                    | Example Problem              | Key Idea                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Opposite End Pointers   | Two Sum (Sorted), Palindrome | Shrink from both ends                                   |
| 2. Same Direction Movement | Container With Most Water    | Move inwards based on condition                         |
| 3. Sliding Window - Fixed  | Max Sum of K-length Subarray | Maintain window of size `k`                             |
| 4. Sliding Window - Varied | Longest Substring w/o Repeat | Expand‚Äìshrink window based on constraints               |
| 5. Fast & Slow Pointers    | Linked List Cycle            | Detect meeting point (cycle detection, middle node etc) |

### 2. **Ask These Questions When Solving Two Pointer Problems**

1. **Do I need to explore pairs/subarrays/substring with certain properties?**
2. **Should I keep the window size fixed or dynamic?**
3. **Do I need to optimize over a sorted array or linear scan?**
4. **Is the array sorted? Can sorting help?**

üëâ **Pattern hint**: If it says ‚Äúcontiguous‚Äù, ‚Äúsubstring‚Äù, ‚Äúsubarray‚Äù, ‚Äúwindow‚Äù ‚Üí Think **Sliding Window**  
üëâ If it asks about ‚Äúpairs/triplets with sum/distance‚Äù ‚Üí Think **Opposite Ends**

### 3. **Must-Master Problems with Each Pattern**

| Problem                                | Pattern                 | Must-Learn Idea                |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1. Two Sum                             | Opposite End            | Work from ends of sorted array |
| 2. Valid Palindrome                    | Opposite End            | Ignore non-alphas and match    |
| 3. Container With Most Water           | Shrink from ends        | Greedy reduce shorter side     |
| 4. Trapping Rain Water                 | Two Pointer Pass        | Track left/right max           |
| 5. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Slow‚ÄìFast Pointer       | Overwrite unique               |
| 6. Longest Substring w/o Repeats       | Sliding Window - Varied | Use HashMap + Shrink left      |
| 7. Max Consecutive Ones III            | Sliding Window - Varied | Use k flips counter            |
| 8. Minimum Size Subarray Sum           | Sliding Window - Shrink | Shrink until sum is valid      |
| 9. Detect Cycle in Linked List         | Fast‚ÄìSlow Pointers      | Check meeting point            |
| 10. Middle of Linked List              | Fast‚ÄìSlow               | Find mid in 1 pass             |

### 4. **Code Templates You Must Memorize**

#### 1. Opposite End (Sorted Array)

```cpp
int i = 0, j = n - 1;
while (i < j) {
    if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) return true;
    else if (arr[i] + arr[j] < target) i++;
    else j--;
}
```

#### 2. Sliding Window - Fixed

```cpp
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) sum += arr[i];
int maxSum = sum;
for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
    maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
}
```

#### 3. Sliding Window - Variable

```cpp
int left = 0, sum = 0, minLen = INT_MAX;
for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
    sum += arr[right];
    while (sum >= target) {
        minLen = min(minLen, right - left + 1);
        sum -= arr[left++];
    }
}
```

#### 4. Fast‚ÄìSlow Pointer (Linked List)

```cpp
ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
while (fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
}
```

### 6. **Tips for Success**

‚úÖ **Use debug prints** to understand how the window expands and shrinks  
‚úÖ **For linked lists**, always visualize pointer jumps on paper  
‚úÖ Know the **difference between "fixed" and "variable" window sizes**  
‚úÖ For subarray problems ‚Üí use `prefix sum` or `sliding window`  
‚úÖ For sorted array + sum = target ‚Üí use `two ends` technique
